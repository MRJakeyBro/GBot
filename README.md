# gbot
Hello, if you are wishing to make GBot nextbots go to the [wiki page](https://github.com/MRJakeyBro/GBot/wiki), otherwise go to the [steam addong page](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3599895778)

Main pathfinding changes:
 - Makes the paths "more straight" as the original nextbot system has a big issue where it moves in weird inconsistant lines,
 - Fixes nextbots not moving or doing anything whithout a navmesh by creating a simple path when it can't make a proper path to a target player,
 - Many others.
